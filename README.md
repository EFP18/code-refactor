# code-refactor

![alt](./assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)


This is the challenge of the first week of the bootcamp. We had to make some changes to the code and the CSS file in order to make the code more accessible and structured correctly. 

After having learned about semantic HTML elements and accessibility standards, 
I was able to make some necessary changes to refactor the code provided by the client. 

Those changes help ensuring that the website is more accessible to people with disabilities.

I achieved this by:
-adhering to accessibility standards, 
-following a correct structure for the code, 
-adjusting the headings so they are in the correct order, 
-adding features that were missing (ex. an id in the navigation bar), and
-adding comments to explain the changes I made and why.
